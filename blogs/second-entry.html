                    All right! Website is just about done. Here's a look at 
                    what the progress is right now (I figure I should archive 
                    the versions it goes through).
                    <br>
                    For now, I'm not being super fussy about the appearance, 
                    because I know the next assignment is to tear it down and
                    start from the top with React.
                    <br>
                    Hope you've enjoyed the look! Have a nice day.
                </p>
