                    All right! Website is just about done. Here's a look at 
                    what the progress is right now (I figure I should archive 
                    the versions it goes through). I have typescript finished, 
                    and I've done a bit of polish on the site's shapes, types and colors
                    with css.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, I'm not being super fussy about the appearance, 
                    because I know the next assignment is to tear it down and
                    start from the top with React.
                    <br>
                    Hope you've enjoyed the look! Have a nice day.
                </p>
